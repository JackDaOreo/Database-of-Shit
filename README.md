You must have VSCode and .NET to edit this code.

If you would like to submit a program FOLLOW THESE RULES:
1. If your program requires multiple methods, create a new '.cs' file named appropriately
2. If your program can be contained within a single method, name a new method appropriately inside 'AllPrograms.cs'
3. Do not touch the file 'MainMenu.cs'. I will add your submission to the list manually to prevent overalpping in listing
4. Do not create any variables outside the scope of your method
5. Make sure that you properly add exception handlers and inside 'catch' is an error message and then the calling of your function to resume execution.
6. Your method may NOT call any other method that is not associated with your program
7. At the top of the method, you must have your name in comment
8. Properly document through comment the purpose of your code to help others better read it.

Note: Do not publish the code before uploading to GitHub as it will become to large to upload.
